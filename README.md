# ðŸ“– The Klingon Translations Project

**Translating the galaxy's most significant cultural and historical texts into tlhIngan Hol.**

---

## Our Vision

The Klingon Translations Project is an ambitious, open-source initiative dedicated to a singular, challenging goal: to translate the most significant works of galactic literature into the Klingon language. Our mission is to bridge cultural divides, explore profound themes through a new lens, and provide a unique resource for both language enthusiasts and students of culture.

While our first major undertaking is the translation of **The Bible**, this project aims to eventually include other foundational texts of philosophy, spirituality, and literature from across the human experience and beyond.

## Current Projects

### 1. The Bible (*pa'qut*)
Our primary focus is the ongoing translation of the Holy Bible. We are translating the text in parallel with English, providing extensive study notes that compare and contrast Judeo-Christian theology with Klingon cultural values, such as honor, duty, and sacrifice.

*   **Progress:** Genesis Chapters 1 & 2 are complete.
*   **Location:** `texts/religious_spirituality/the_bible/`

### 2. (Future Projects)
*   *Shakespeare*
*   *The Tao Te Ching*
*   *...and more, based on community suggestions!*

## How to Contribute
This is a monumental undertaking, and we welcome all who wish to lend their strength to the cause. We are seeking:
*   **Translators & Linguists:** For expertise in Klingon, Hebrew, Greek, and English.
*   **Scholars & Theologians:** To provide cultural and theological context.
*   **Community Reviewers:** To help proofread and ensure clarity.
