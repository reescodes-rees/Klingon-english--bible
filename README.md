# Project "Hegh'batlh": The Human-Klingon Bible

**A Project of Intercultural Translation and Understanding**

*Hegh'batlh (n.): Honor-Duty; a sacred obligation.*

---

## Vision Statement

Project "Hegh'batlh" is a unique scholarly and creative venture to translate the English Bible into a new edition that is enriched with study notes and commentary from both human and Klingon cultural perspectives. Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding of the text by exploring its themes through the lens of two vastly different cultures. This project is not just about translation; it's about building bridges and sparking new conversations.

The profits generated from this venture will be dedicated to a continuing mission: funding the translation of other significant historical and cultural texts, ensuring that knowledge and stories from across the galaxy are preserved and shared.

## Project Goals

*   **Translation:** To produce a clear and faithful translation of the English Bible.
*   **Dual-Perspective Commentary:** To create a running commentary that analyzes the text from:
    *   **A Human Perspective:** Drawing on centuries of theological, historical, and cultural scholarship.
    *   **A Klingon Perspective:** Interpreting the text through the cultural values of honor, duty, sacrifice, and the warrior's spirit. How would a Klingon understand the story of Abraham and Isaac? What are the parallels between the story of Kahless and the life of Moses?
*   **Discussion and Study:** To include questions and discussion topics designed to provoke thought and conversation among readers, whether they are studying alone or in groups.
*   **Audio Version:** To create a full audio production of the translation and commentary, making the project accessible to all.
*   **Philanthropy:** To create a self-sustaining model where the success of this project funds future translations of other important works.

## How to Contribute

This is a monumental task, and we welcome all who wish to lend their strength to the cause. Qapla'! We are seeking contributors in the following areas:

*   **Translators:** Fluent in English and experienced in biblical translation.

*   **Klingon Cultural Experts:** Fans and scholars with a deep knowledge of Klingon culture, language, and history as depicted in Star Trek.
*   **Editors:** To ensure consistency, clarity, and quality.
*   **Artists:** To create illustrations that capture the spirit of the project.
