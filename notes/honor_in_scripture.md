## Genesis 1: Naming as Authority

- **Concept:** The act of naming parts of creation (e.g., "sky," "land," "seas") demonstrates authority and ownership.
- **Klingon Parallel:** In Klingon culture, naming is a powerful act often associated with a warrior's claim over a territory or a victory. To name something is to assert dominance over it.
